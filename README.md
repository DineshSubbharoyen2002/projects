# 1.Shortest Distance between 2 points(dist.java)

  I have provided the optimized code for shortest distance between two points using sqrt method in Math class which minimizes the run-time and compile-time of the code
  It uses no for loop and  the result is directly printed using Math.sqrt() method which optimizes the code to the extent.
  
 # 2.Optimized code for prime number(prime.java)
 
 It is optimized due to only one for loop.First a flag f is set to 1 which is basically true and 0 represents false, first if condition checks whether the number is negative or zero then turns the flag to 0(false),Second if condition checks whether the number is 2 and returns true since it is a prime number,third if condition checks for even numbers and at last the for loop checks the odd number, It is optimized because it only checks odd number and returns false ,if it does not satisfy any condition returns true which is default and acts as an else condition.

# 3.Generate a star pattern using number 7(star.java)

The code is optimized to print a star using number 7 ,The pattern is made by using 3 steps or 3 main for loops first a pyramid is printed then the middle pattern is printed and finally 2 inverted pyramid(pyjama pattern) is printed which makes a star pattern.

# 4.Error Handling using Rest API

  This is the optimized code for error handling is done using Nodejs and RestAPI
